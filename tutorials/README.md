# Tutorials
This directory consist of various code snippets of tutorials that I've move through.
### What I've Learned:
- **test-bs4.py:** Simple test to see if bs4 library works properly.
- **extract-urls.py:** Extracting urls of a web page.
- **extract-all-pages-urls.py:** Mapping a website.
- **youtube-comments.py:** Failed tutorial. Just tried to implement comment scraper for Youtube.

It looks like BeautifulSoup library isn't enough for some cases. Selenium is way more sophisticated tool to scrape these cases ( Only these cases because it isn't fast as BeautifulSoup ). I realized that while trying to scrape Youtube comments as you can see at "youtube-comments.py" file. I will try to do this task by using Selenium.

- **simple-selenium.py:** Testing selenium installation.
